# Node JS Interview Questions

### Q.1 What is node.js ?

**Answer:**
Node.js is a runtime environment for javascript that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side outside of a web browser.
*   **Built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine:** - This gives Node.js high performance in executing JavaScript code.
*   **Non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture:** - This makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications like chat apps, online games, or live notifications.
*   **Used for backend development:** - While JavaScript is traditionally used on the client side (browser), Node.js lets you build the server side using JavaScript too.


### Q.2 Advantages of node.js

**Answer:**
*   **Fast Performance:** - Built on Chrome’s V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript to machine code.
Handles many operations (like file reads, network requests) asynchronously, making it highly efficient.
*   **Asynchronous & Non-Blocking I/O:** - Executes multiple tasks in parallel without waiting for one to finish.
Ideal for real-time applications (e.g., chats, live updates).
*   **Cross-Platform Development:** - Useful in building tools, desktop apps (with Electron), APIs, and even IoT solutions.
