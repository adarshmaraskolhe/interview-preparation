## Q.1 What is Event Loop?

**Answer:**
* The Event Loop is the core mechanism that lets Node.js handle asynchronous, non-blocking operations on a single thread.
* It works with libuv to offload I/O tasks (like file reads, HTTP requests) to the system or thread pool.

* Once tasks are complete, the event loop queues their callbacks and executes them one by one.

* **It has phases like:**

    *  Timers (setTimeout, setInterval) 

    *  Poll (I/O callbacks)

    * Check (setImmediate)

    * Microtasks (Promise.then, async/await)

* Microtasks run before the next phase of the loop.


## Q.2 What is Callback queue?

**Answer:**
The Callback Queue (also called the Task Queue) is where ready-to-run asynchronous callbacks wait to be executed by the Event Loop.

**How It Works:**
* You run some async code like setTimeout, fs.readFile, or an HTTP request.

<!-- * Node.js offloads the task using libuv(worker threads do the job in background). -->
* Node.js offloads certain asynchronous tasks to libuv, which may use a thread pool (worker threads in libuv, not JavaScript Worker Threads) to perform the work in the background.

* When the task finishes, its callback function is pushed to the Callback Queue.

* The Event Loop picks callbacks from the queue and executes them when the call stack is empty and after microtasks are done.

## Q.3 Execution of callbacks

```javascript
    console.log("Start");

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("From Callback Queue");
        }, 0);

    Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("From Microtask Queue");
    });

    console.log("End");
```
**Answer:**
```sql
    Start
    End
    From Microtask Queue
    From Callback Queue
```
* Even though setTimeout(..., 0) has 0ms delay, the microtask (Promise.then) runs first.
Promises have higher priority in event loop.



## Q.4 `process.nextTick()` in Node.js?

**Answer:**
`process.nextTick()` is a special function in Node.js that schedules a callback to be executed immediately after the current operation completes, before the event loop continues to the next phase.

* What It Does
    * Adds the callback to the "next tick queue", which is processed after the current function, but before any I/O or timers.

    * It has higher priority than Promises and other asynchronous tasks.

```javascript

    console.log("Start");

    process.nextTick(() => {
    console.log("process.nextTick");
    });

    Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("Promise.then");
    });

    setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("setTimeout");
    }, 0);

    console.log("End");

```

* **Output:**
```sql
    Start
    End
    process.nextTick
    Promise.then
    setTimeout
```


## Q.5 `setImmediate()` in Node.js?

**Answer:**
`setImmediate()` is a Node.js function that schedules a callback to be executed in the next iteration (tick) of the event loop, after I/O events are processed.
* **Execution Order Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("setTimeout");
  }, 0);

  setImmediate(() => {
    console.log("setImmediate");
  });
});
```
* **Output:**
```arduino
setImmediate
setTimeout
```
* Inside I/O callbacks, setImmediate() usually runs before setTimeout() because of how the event loop phases work.


## Q.6 `setTimeout()` in Node.js?

**Answer:**
`setTimeout()` is a built-in function used to schedule code to run after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It places the callback in the Timers phase of the Node.js event loop.

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 1000); // runs after ~1 sec

console.log("End");

```
* Output:

```sql
Start
End
Inside setTimeout

```

## Q.7 Streams in Node.js?

**Answer:**
* Streams in Node.js are abstractions for working with data that is read or written sequentially over time, rather than loading it all at once.

* **They're especially useful for:**

    * Handling large files

    * Network communication

    * Efficient memory usage

* **Benefits of Streams:**
    * Efficient memory usage

    * Handles large files or data sources

    * Enables piping for clean code

    * Built into Node's core modules (like fs, http, net, zlib)

* **Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Read from a file and write to another using streams
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

// Pipe the data from readStream to writeStream
readStream.pipe(writeStream);

console.log("File copied using stream");

```

## Q.8 Buffers in Node.js?

**Answer:**
Buffers in Node.js are used to handle binary data directly in memory — especially useful when dealing with file systems, streams, or network operations.

Unlike strings (which handle text), buffers are used to work with raw binary data — sequences of bytes.

* Why Buffers?

    JavaScript (by default) does not support binary data well. Node.js introduces the Buffer class to fill that gap, particularly for:

    - File I/O (fs.readFile, fs.createReadStream)

    - Networking (net, http)

    - Streaming binary data (images, PDFs, etc.)
* **Example:**
```javascript
const buf1 = Buffer.from("Hello");
console.log(buf1);           // <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f>
console.log(buf1.toString()); // "Hello"
```
