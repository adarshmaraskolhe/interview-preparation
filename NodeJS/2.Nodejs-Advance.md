## Q.1 What is Event Loop?

**Answer:**
* The Event Loop is the core mechanism that lets Node.js handle asynchronous, non-blocking operations on a single thread.
* It works with libuv to offload I/O tasks (like file reads, HTTP requests) to the system or thread pool.

* Once tasks are complete, the event loop queues their callbacks and executes them one by one.

**It has phases like:**

*  Timers (setTimeout, setInterval) 

*  Poll (I/O callbacks)

* Check (setImmediate)

* Microtasks (Promise.then, async/await)

Microtasks run before the next phase of the loop.
