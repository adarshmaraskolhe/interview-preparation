## Q.1 What is Event Loop?

**Answer:**
* The Event Loop is the core mechanism that lets Node.js handle asynchronous, non-blocking operations on a single thread.
* It works with libuv to offload I/O tasks (like file reads, HTTP requests) to the system or thread pool.

* Once tasks are complete, the event loop queues their callbacks and executes them one by one.

* **It has phases like:**

    *  Timers (setTimeout, setInterval) 

    *  Poll (I/O callbacks)

    * Check (setImmediate)

    * Microtasks (Promise.then, async/await)

* Microtasks run before the next phase of the loop.


## Q.2 What is Callback queue?

**Answer:**
The Callback Queue (also called the Task Queue) is where ready-to-run asynchronous callbacks wait to be executed by the Event Loop.

**How It Works:**
* You run some async code like setTimeout, fs.readFile, or an HTTP request.

<!-- * Node.js offloads the task using libuv(worker threads do the job in background). -->
* Node.js offloads certain asynchronous tasks to libuv, which may use a thread pool (worker threads in libuv, not JavaScript Worker Threads) to perform the work in the background.

* When the task finishes, its callback function is pushed to the Callback Queue.

* The Event Loop picks callbacks from the queue and executes them when the call stack is empty and after microtasks are done.

## Q.3 Execution of callbacks

```javascript
    console.log("Start");

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("From Callback Queue");
        }, 0);

    Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("From Microtask Queue");
    });

    console.log("End");
```
**Answer:**
```sql
    Start
    End
    From Microtask Queue
    From Callback Queue
```
* Even though setTimeout(..., 0) has 0ms delay, the microtask (Promise.then) runs first.
Promises have higher priority in event loop.



## Q.4 `process.nextTick()` in Node.js?

**Answer:**
`process.nextTick()` is a special function in Node.js that schedules a callback to be executed immediately after the current operation completes, before the event loop continues to the next phase.

* What It Does
    * Adds the callback to the "next tick queue", which is processed after the current function, but before any I/O or timers.

    * It has higher priority than Promises and other asynchronous tasks.

```javascript

    console.log("Start");

    process.nextTick(() => {
    console.log("process.nextTick");
    });

    Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("Promise.then");
    });

    setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("setTimeout");
    }, 0);

    console.log("End");

```

* **Output:**
```sql
    Start
    End
    process.nextTick
    Promise.then
    setTimeout
```


## Q.5 `setImmediate()` in Node.js?

**Answer:**
`setImmediate()` is a Node.js function that schedules a callback to be executed in the next iteration (tick) of the event loop, after I/O events are processed.
* **Execution Order Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("setTimeout");
  }, 0);

  setImmediate(() => {
    console.log("setImmediate");
  });
});
```
* **Output:**
```arduino
setImmediate
setTimeout
```
* Inside I/O callbacks, setImmediate() usually runs before setTimeout() because of how the event loop phases work.


## Q.6 `setTimeout()` in Node.js?

**Answer:**
`setTimeout()` is a built-in function used to schedule code to run after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It places the callback in the Timers phase of the Node.js event loop.

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 1000); // runs after ~1 sec

console.log("End");

```
* Output:

```sql
Start
End
Inside setTimeout

```

## Q.7 Streams in Node.js?

**Answer:**
* Streams in Node.js are abstractions for working with data that is read or written sequentially over time, rather than loading it all at once.

* **They're especially useful for:**

    * Handling large files

    * Network communication

    * Efficient memory usage

* **Benefits of Streams:**
    * Efficient memory usage

    * Handles large files or data sources

    * Enables piping for clean code

    * Built into Node's core modules (like fs, http, net, zlib)

* **Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Read from a file and write to another using streams
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

// Pipe the data from readStream to writeStream
readStream.pipe(writeStream);

console.log("File copied using stream");

```

## Q.8 Buffers in Node.js?

**Answer:**
Buffers in Node.js are used to handle binary data directly in memory — especially useful when dealing with file systems, streams, or network operations.

Unlike strings (which handle text), buffers are used to work with raw binary data — sequences of bytes.

* Why Buffers?

    JavaScript (by default) does not support binary data well. Node.js introduces the Buffer class to fill that gap, particularly for:

    - File I/O (fs.readFile, fs.createReadStream)

    - Networking (net, http)

    - Streaming binary data (images, PDFs, etc.)
* **Example:**
```javascript
const buf1 = Buffer.from("Hello");
console.log(buf1);           // <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f>
console.log(buf1.toString()); // "Hello"
```

## Q.9 Clusters in Node.js?

**Answer:**
Clusters in Node.js enable you to scale your application by utilizing multiple CPU cores. Since Node.js runs in a single-threaded event loop, clusters allow you to run multiple instances of your app, each on its own thread (child process), and share the same port.

* **Example:**
```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(`👑 Master process ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Fork workers
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  // If a worker dies, fork a new one
  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`💀 Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
    cluster.fork();
  });

} else {
  // Worker processes have a HTTP server
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(`Hello from worker ${process.pid}\n`);
  }).listen(3000);

  console.log(`🚧 Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}

```


## Q.10 Child Process

**Answer:**
Child Process in Node.js allows you to run external programs or scripts in separate processes, enabling parallel execution outside the main event loop.

Runs in isolated memory space.

The `child_process.spawn()`, `child_process.fork()`, `child_process.exec()`, and `child_process.execFile()` are the methods methods which support the creation of sub-processes asynchronously.
* `exec()` → good for small outputs, returns a buffer
* `spawn()` → good for large/streamed output
* `fork()` → best for Node.js scripts and message passing
```javascript
const { fork } = require('child_process');
const child = fork('worker.js');
child.send({ task: 'processData' });

```


## Q.11 Worker threads

**Answer:**
Worker Threads allow you to run JavaScript code in parallel threads (within the same process) — ideal for CPU-bound tasks that would otherwise block the event loop.

Runs in shared memory space.(via `SharedArrayBuffer`)

Used for mathematical operations or cryptography in Node.js


## Q.12 Callback hell (Pyramid of doom)

**Answer:**
Callback hell, also known as the "Pyramid of Doom," refers to a situation in programming where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read, understand, and maintain. This often occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations, like making API calls or handling file I/O, where one operation depends on the completion of another. 

The asynchronous function requires callbacks as a return parameter. When multiple asynchronous functions are chained together then callback hell situation comes up. 

```javascript
```
## Q.13 What are Event Listeners ? 

**Answer:**
**Event Listeners** are similar to call back functions but are associated with some event. For example when a server listens to http request on a given port a event will be generated and to specify http server has received and will invoke corresponding event listener. Basically, Event listener's are also call backs for a corresponding event.

Node.js has built in event's and built in event listeners. Node.js also provides functionality to create Custom events and Custom Event listeners.

## Q.14 What is Event Emmitter ?

**Answer:**
All objects that emit events are members of EventEmitter class. These objects expose an `eventEmitter.on()` function that allows one or more functions to be attached to named events emitted by the object.

When the EventEmitter object emits an event, all of the functions attached to that specific event are called synchronously. 

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('an event occurred!');
});
myEmitter.emit('event');
```

## Q.15 What is REPL in context of Node?

**Answer:**
**REPL** stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment like a window console or unix/linux shell where a command is entered and system responds with an output. Node.js or Node comes bundled with a REPL environment. It performs the following desired tasks.

*   **Read** \- Reads user's input, parse the input into JavaScript data-structure and stores in memory.
*   **Eval** \- Takes and evaluates the data structure
*   **Print** \- Prints the result
*   **Loop** \- Loops the above command until user press ctrl-c twice.
