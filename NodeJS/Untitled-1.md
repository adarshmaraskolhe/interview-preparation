Here’s a list of **advanced Node.js topics** that go beyond the basics and are essential for building robust, scalable, and high-performance backend applications:

---

## 🔧 **1. Event Loop & Concurrency Deep Dive**

* Phases of the Event Loop
* Task queues: **macrotasks** vs **microtasks**
* `process.nextTick()` vs `setImmediate()` vs `setTimeout()`
* How Node.js handles **concurrent** tasks despite being single-threaded

---

## 🌐 **2. Cluster Module and Worker Threads**

* Using the `cluster` module to utilize **multi-core CPUs**
* Scaling Node.js apps with **multiple processes**
* Difference between **cluster** and **worker\_threads**

---

## 🔁 **3. Streams and Buffers**

* Working with **streams** for large file/data processing

  * Types: Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform
* Managing **memory** with **Buffer**
* Example: Stream file uploads or log processing

---

## 🕸️ **4. Asynchronous Patterns**

* Callbacks, Promises, `async/await`
* **Error handling** in async code
* Managing **control flow** with libraries like `async.js`

---

## 🛠️ **5. Building and Using Custom Modules**

* Writing your own CommonJS/ES6 modules
* Exporting functions, classes, objects
* Using `require` vs `import`

---

## 📦 **6. Dependency Management with NPM/Yarn**

* Creating reusable packages
* Semantic Versioning (semver)
* Working with `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
* NPM scripts and lifecycle events

---

## 🛡️ **7. Security in Node.js**

* Avoiding common vulnerabilities: XSS, CSRF, Injection
* Using `helmet`, `cors`, and rate limiters
* Securing environment variables with `dotenv`

---

## 🔐 **8. Authentication & Authorization**

* JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
* Role-based access control (RBAC)

---

## 🔥 **9. Real-Time Communication**

* Using **WebSockets** with `socket.io`
* Building real-time apps like chats, live dashboards

---

## 🌲 **10. Logging and Monitoring**

* Using logging tools: `winston`, `morgan`, `bunyan`
* Monitoring performance with `PM2`, `New Relic`, or `Datadog`

---

## 🧪 **11. Testing in Node.js**

* Unit testing with `Jest`, `Mocha`, `Chai`
* Integration testing
* Test coverage and mocking

---

## 🏗️ **12. Advanced Express.js Concepts**

* Middleware chaining and error handling
* Route-level middleware
* Organizing large applications using **MVC** or **modular folder structure**

---

## ⚙️ **13. Process Management and Deployment**

* Using `PM2` or `forever` for production process management
* Graceful shutdown and cleanup
* Deploying Node apps on cloud (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel)

---

## 📡 **14. Working with Databases Efficiently**

* MongoDB with Mongoose (NoSQL)
* PostgreSQL with Sequelize / Prisma (SQL)
* Connection pooling, indexing, and query optimization

---

## 🧠 **15. Performance Optimization**

* CPU profiling and memory leak detection
* Reducing event loop lag
* Load testing tools: `Artillery`, `k6`, `Apache Bench`
