# Angular Interview Questions

## Q.1 What is Angular ?

**Answer:**  Angular is a powerful and popular open-source front-end framework primarily used for building single-page web applications (SPAs) and dynamic web applications. Developed and maintained by Google, it offers a comprehensive set of tools and libraries to streamline development, enabling developers to create robust, scalable, and maintainable applications. 

## Q.2 Why Typescript is used in Angular ?

**Answer:** Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which adds static typing, improving code readability and maintainability. 

* **Static Typing :** TypeScript lets you define types (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `custom interfaces`). This means:
    * You catch errors at compile time, not runtime.
    * It helps prevent bugs due to incorrect data usage.

* TypeScript supports **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** Features
    * Classes

    * Interfaces

    * Inheritance

    * Access modifiers (private, public, protected)

## Q.3 What is component in Angular ?

**Answer:**
A Component is the fundamental building block of the user interface. Every view you see in an Angular application is controlled by a component.

* A component in Angular is made up of:

    * Class – typescript class that contains logic and data

    * Template (HTML) – defines the UI

    * Styles (CSS) – defines the look and feel

    * Metadata (`@Component`decorator) – tells Angular how to use the component


## Q.3 Directives

**Answer:**
Directives are special instructions in the DOM (Document Object Model) that tell Angular to do something with an element or component. They are used to manipulate the structure or behavior of the DOM.


| Type           | Description                                            | Example                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Component**  | A directive with a template (i.e., actual UI)          | `@Component`                      |
| **Structural** | Changes the structure of the DOM (add/remove elements) | `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`    |
| **Attribute**  | Changes the appearance or behavior of an element       | `ngClass`, `ngStyle`              |
